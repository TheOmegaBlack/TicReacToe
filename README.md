# TicReacToe
### A version of TicTacToe made with React and Redux. Started with my own [ReactReduxStarterPack](https://github.com/TheOmegaBlack/SachasReactReduxStarterPack).

## Getting Started

```
> git clone https://github.com/TheOmegaBlack/TicReacToe.git
> cd TicReacToe
> npm install
> npm start
> go to localhost:8080 on your browser (you can change it by adding "devServer: {port: YOURPORT}," to webpack.config.js. Write the port number you want instead of YOURPORT. )
```

## About this game
It works in a pretty straightforward way. I didn't really add comments but it should be easy to understand what everything does.
The game restarts after 3 seconds. The CPU takes 1 second to (pretend to) think. You can change those values by simply editing the action in 'actions/main.js'.

#Time travel
Click on any of the buttons that will appear below the grid and you will be able to go back to the corresponding turn. Pretty awesome!

## What's next
Nothing planned, but I am happy to hear your ideas.
